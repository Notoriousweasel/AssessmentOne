// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."; 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, it is a process used to determine the needs and expectations of a new product. It involves frequent communication with the stakeholders and end-users of the product to define expectations, resolve conflicts, and document all the key requirements.";
const design = "This is the thrid step, this is the process to transform the user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.";
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, involving installing a new hardware or software system or application. It can also mean the inclusion of a specific technical specification, software component or software standard. For example, software development tools contain implementations of a programming language.";
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, we use a type of software testing in which the different units, modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity.";
const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step, this is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Software maintenance is done after the product has launched for several reasons including improving the software overall, correcting issues or bugs, to boost performance, and more.";
